                    <br> Subject: Internship

                    <br> To whom it may concern,
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am Ms. Wagner's Marketing professor. She is a great student, with lots of character
                    and
                    work ethic.I have known her for about a year and she was always respectful and engaging during
                    class. I
                    would say her best strength is that she is a great leader, but knows when to be a follower as
                    well.She will be a great asset to your company/organization and should be considered for your
                    internship.
                    If any additional information is needed, I can be reached at (815)777-8888.


                    <br>Sincerely,
