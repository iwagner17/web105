        <h2>Parents</h2>
        <p> My mother is Dawn and she is amazing. She has traveled to 28 countries, so she inspires me to venture out of
            my comfort zone.
            I consider my grandpa Bill, as a father-figure as well because he is the one i talk to when i need advice
            and
            guidance.</p>

        <h2>Best-Friend</h2>
        <P> I met Neveen in highschool junior year. We went to Harvard Highschool. Neveen and I have worked together and
            we have also gone through alot of leadership programs,
            that we know each other too well. She makes the best coffee. She just got married last week, so time is
            flying fast.
