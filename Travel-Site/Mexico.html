        <p> I was born in Puebla, Mexico. I don't remember how it looks because I was 3 years old when
            my family moved to the U.S. The only memories I can make of it, are from the stories i've been told. This
            will be
            my first travel destination, because i want to connect with the culture that my family is associated to.
        </p>
        <p>Publa is located in the southern part of Mexico. It's a colonial styled town because it was colonized
            by the Spaniards. Puebla has a total of 365 churches. It's mostly known for it's Cinco de Mayo battle.
            On May 5th,1862 Mexico defeated the French.</p>
